Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ahmed Hammad
A passionate backend developer from Egypt

Iâ€™m currently working on building backend systems with ASP.NET Core (MVC & Web API), and improving my skills in Entity Framework Core, LINQ, and SQL Server.

Iâ€™m currently learning more about database design, backend architecture, and API performance optimization.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend systems using ASP.NET Core, and Iâ€™m open to freelance opportunities or junior backend roles.

All of my projects are available at: [https://github.com/ahmedhammad-dotnet]

Ask me about anything related to .NET backend development, C#, OOP, SQL Server, or getting started with backend development.
